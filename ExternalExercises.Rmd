## The Issue

Users expect to see exercises in a textbook. For *Loss Data Analytics*, we have many sources and types of exercises that we can draw upon. The issue is deciding upon the type to re-inforce the emphasis of the book.

Currently, the book features almost as many different exercise types as there are authors. Some chapters have no exercises, others have an extensive amount.

See also some questions in a [Future Work](https://github.com/ewfrees/InteractiveLDA/tree/master/FutureWork) folder on this site.

These differing viewpoints are also reflected in the examples in the book. To illustrative, some chapters focus on mathmatical/statistical developments, some on data analytic  aspects, some on business content. This is the good and bad associated with a heterogenous collection of authors.

We can reduce the effects of this heterogeneity by providing a large pool of exercises. Some may exist outside of the book. With a large pool of exercises, users (teachers) can draw upon the subset that reflects their area of interests.

## Wordpress Exercises

Here is a series of exercises that guide the viewer through some of the theoretical foundations of *Loss Data Analytics*. Each tutorial is based on one or more questions from the professional actuarial examinations â€“ typically the Society of Actuaries short term actuarial mathematics exam that used to be known as "Exam C." These exercises are coded using **Wordpress**. 

We can explore bringing them into the `R` **Bookdown** environment.

# Statistical Code {#S:StatisticalCode}

*  As the baseline, we have already remarked that `R` statistical code appears in the text, although it does not overwhelm readers via the *Show/Hide* features that we are using.

* It will be straight forward to also include **Python** code in the same fashion.

*  We have a [supporting site for statistical code](https://ewfrees.github.io/LDARcode/index.html) that allows viewers to get more experience analyzying loss data using `R`.

*  There are a variety of ways of learning coding procedures interactively. One option is [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com). In particular, they have developed an `R` package, [Datacamp Light](https://support.datacamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007749853-What-is-DataCamp-Light-). This allows us to integrate this interactive approach into our authoring system. [Here](https://ewfreesres.github.io/RegressModel/index.html) is a link to an online regression tutorial done using this approach. There are a few little technical details but we think these are now ironed out. This is a promising option that will help make the book special.
